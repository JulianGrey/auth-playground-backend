# My Auth Playground

This is a project to help me expand my Frontend knowledge into the backend, with the intent of growing into a Full-Stack Developer. The purpose of this project is to expose myself to all the areas of service creation, log-in / log-out flow, authentication and authorisation, and anything else that I come across as I aim to build my expertise.
